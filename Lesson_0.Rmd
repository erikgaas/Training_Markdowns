Before getting started programming in R, you will have to download some things. First you will want
to download the actual R programming language. If you are going to be using a Windows machine, then you will
want to download R from [this link](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/). For a Mac you will be
downloading form [here](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/). If you are on a Linux machine, you will have to choose the package suited for your particular distribution. In many cases this is easier than Mac/Windows
install because it just means downloading R from the command line. The cran website provides some nice
instructions for this [here](http://cran.us.r-project.org/bin/linux/). Just follow the folders to your
distribution. If your's is not included here, just do a simple google search "install R <your distribution>".
This works just as well if you substitute your distribution with Mac or Windows as well. As websites go, the
[cran website](http://cran.us.r-project.org/) is pretty good, so feel free to rumage around there for
some additional resources.

Once you download that, you will be taken through an installation process. Once that has completed, you
will have the full functionality of R at your disposal. At this point we could perform any conceivable R
task that we like. However, there is a really nice Integrated Development Environment (IDE) which provides
some convenient tools which makes R programming feel more fluid than the base R interactive prompt. To
download this, go to [this link](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). Choose the link for
your operating system and go through a very similar installation process. RStudio will also verify that R has
already been propoerly installed, so if it does not see your R install you might need to repeat the steps from
the previous paragraph.

Once RStudio has been installed (and perhaps you have restarted your system), go ahead and open the
application. You will be greeted by three Windows. This might look something like this.

On the lefthand side, you will probably have just one window instead of two. Your window is the console.
Its role is to listen to anything you say line by line and execute it on the fly. It is just as if you have
an assitant that will promply perform any command that you may have. As you do this, you will be gathering
data and putting labels on that data. These labels will show up in the upper right hand corner as you
receive results from your console assistant. The lower right corner is simply a representation of the folders
in your primary drive.

Sometimes quick commands are not robust enough for what we want to do, so instead of telling our assitant to
do interactively, we would like to write down a laundry list of steps on what to do to solve our problem, only
retrieving the data we actually care about. This is what the upper left window is for which is present on my
screen, but not on yours. As you might have noticed, it can also be used to create these lessons! Be warned
though. The console assistant will do whatever you say EXACTLY as you say it. It does not understand the
context with which you are solving the problem. It also is strict on syntax. If you do not include a quote
where there should be a quote, your assitant will complain and stop executing.

Before we get to the real part of the course, we will install an interactive lesson tool called Swirl.
To do this type the following in order, pressing enter between lines.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("swirl")
library("swirl")
```

The first line downloads the swirl package and the second line takes those functions in the swirl package
and makes them available for your own use. This is sort of analagous to buing a book and then opening it.

Now that this is done, to run swirl, simply type:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
swirl()
```

At this point swirl will introduce itself to you and give you a brief demonstration on what you can do with
it. It will probably come pre-loaded with some sample courses. Take a peek around and come back when you
have familiarized yourself.

Now that this is done we are going to want to download the TA_Training course. Luckily this is very easy
with this command:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install_course_github("erikgaas", "TA_Training")
```

Once this is done you can enter swirl again, just as you did before, and notice that TA_Training has been
added to your course list and there are lessons displaed within that course.

One more tricky thing. More lessons will be added or revised over time, so the course will need to be
updated intermitently. To do this is not as simple as downloading it again. You must uninstall the course
and then download it again like so:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
uninstall_course("TA_Training")
install_course_github("erikgaas", "TA_Training")
```

It would be good practice to run this entire section of code every time you open R Studio to keep things
up to date:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library("swirl")
uninstall_course("TA_Training")
install_course_github("erikgaas", "TA_Training")
```

Now that your R environment is all setup, we can get into some of the real lessons to learn how it
actually works.
